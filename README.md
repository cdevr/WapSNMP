WapSnmp : SNMP client for golang
--------------------------------

# This fork seeks to add SNMP V3 capability 
# Original README
This is an open-source SNMP client library for Go. This allows you to query SNMP servers for any variable, given it's OID (no MIB resolution).

This library has been written to be in Go style and that means it should be very resistent to all conditions. It's entirely non-blocking/asynchronous and very, very fast. It's also surprisingly small and easy to understand.

It supports SNMPv2c or lower (not 3, due to it's complexity), and supports all methods provided as part of that standard. Get, GetMultiple (which are really the same request, but ...), GetNext and GetBulk.

It has been tested on juniper and cisco devices and has proven to remain stable over long periods of time.

Example:

  func DoGetTableTest(target string) {
        community := "public"
        version := SNMPv2c

        oid := MustParseOid(".1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.3.2.3.1.20")

        fmt.Printf("Contacting %v %v %v\n", target, community, version)
        wsnmp, err := NewWapSNMP(target, community, version, 2*time.Second, 5)
        defer wsnmp.Close()
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("Error creating wsnmp => %v\n", wsnmp)
                return
        }

        table, err := wsnmp.GetTable(oid)
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("Error getting table => %v\n", wsnmp)
                return
        }
        for k, v := range table {
                fmt.Printf("%v => %v\n", k, v)
        }
  }

This library can also be used as a ASN1 BER parser.
